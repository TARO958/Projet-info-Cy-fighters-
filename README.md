# CY Fighters
```
This project for CY-Tech is a solo and local multiplayer fighting game which can be played with up to two players.
It is the result of our mutual work, of all of our combined ideas brought by our original and inventive creativity.
In order to create that game, we had to use all the knowledge we acquired in class.
It was a very enlightening project.
We didn't expect it to be that time-consuming and it took us quite some time to get it done.
We had a lot of fun creating this game.
In this game, we chose our bots to have 4 levels of difficulty, "noob" one can only use basique att and focus the first ennemie, the second "easy" can use att spe 1 and focus the first ennemie , the third "normal" can use att spe 1, spe 2 and focus the first ennemie,the last level "the hard one" can usecan use att spe 1 ? spe 2 focus the best ennemie to focus. Concerning the order of passage of the selctioning characters, the first players to att is the one with the most speed  and so on .
