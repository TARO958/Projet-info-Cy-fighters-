# CY Fighters
```
This project for CY-Tech is a fight who can be played by one or two players in local.
for this project we put all the knowledge see in class and all the ideas that we have in our mind , it's was very instructive project like for the organisation,
I didnâ€™t know it would take me so long and be so rigorous .We take a lot of fun to create this game because he give many possibilities of immagination. In this game we choose our rule like the bots have 4 levels of difficulty ,the first "noob" one can only use basique att and focus the first ennemie, the second"easy" can use att spe 1 and focus the first ennemie , the third"normal" can use att spe 1, spe 2 and focus the first ennemie,the last level "the hard one" can usecan use att spe 1? spe 2 focus the best ennemie to focus.Concerning the order of passage of the selctioning characters, the first players to att is the one with the most speed  and so on .
